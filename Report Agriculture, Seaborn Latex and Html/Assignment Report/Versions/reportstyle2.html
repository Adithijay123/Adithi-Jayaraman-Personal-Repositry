            The dataset that I have selected for this module is a "Crop Recommendation Dataset". This dataset is published by ICFA IBER of Food and Agriculture. This dataset was build by augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate and fertilizer data available for India. Gathered over the period by ICFA, India.</p>
            Precision agriculture helps the farmers to make informed decision about the farming strategy. I have looked into a dataset which would allow the stakeholder to find the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters</p>
            Using this dataset I would like to help my stake holder look into Crop Recommendation Using Weather and Soil Content, and recomend a ideal crop for their specific soil and weather conditions to get the most yeild, during a given season.
            </p>
            <p>Agriculture is the primary source of income for the great majority of Indians and is essential to the nation's economy. The most common problem faced by Indian farmers is that they select crops without considering the needs of the land, which significantly reduces their production.</p>
            <p>This issue can be resolved with the use of data-analysis of past year data points and the profit margin for that pertucal year for a specific database. Three factors are taken into account by this report: weather conditions, soil properties, and  the maximum yeild of a specific crop .</p>

# GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub!
I am Adithi, a second-year Robotics student at Falmouth University. This repo highlights a range of my projects, from AI and robotics to data analysis. I'm currently researching how to optimise genetic algorithms for maze-solving when the path is unknown to the agent, as well as exploring algorithm performance in the Santa Fe Trail problem. Alongside this, I'm working with my team on a robotic art installation for Falmouth Art Gallery's summer exhibit.
